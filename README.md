Given a string as input, output its characters alphabetically sorted from A to Z. 

For Example: 

Input: challenge 

Output: aceeghlln 

Number should go first: 

Input: happy42 

Output: 24ahppy 

Special characters, such as symbols, go before numbers and letters: 

Input: $tar3 

Output: $3art 

Whitespaces should be ignored.
